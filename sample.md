James and I (self.shortscarystories)

James and I used to be best friends. 
Twins always seem to have a special bond. 
That’s of course until they took him away. As we got older 
he seemed to always be focused on something else; distant from the family. 
He began to cause a lot of trouble. Stealing small things from convenience stores, lying, 
and eventually mutilating animals. He got off on it i guess. The idea of slicing helpless 
animals apart and tearing out their body parts made him happy. The warmth of their 
intestines between his fingers. He was caught eventually and taken away. For good. 
Luckily they took the wrong brother. 
It’s been so tempting lately to get my hands on a little critter, but I’m managing.
