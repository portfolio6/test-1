THERE'S SOMEONE UNDER THE BED
Sometimes the very short ghost stories are the best, and this tale, from Reddit via Buzzfeed, tells the story of a father putting his young son to bed:
“I begin tucking him into bed and he tells me, “Daddy, check for monsters under my bed.” 
I look underneath for his amusement and see him, another him, under the bed, 
staring back at me quivering and whispering, “Daddy, there’s somebody on my bed.”
