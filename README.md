THERE'S SOMEONE UNDER THE BED
Sometimes the very short ghost stories are the best, and this tale, from Reddit via Buzzfeed, tells the story of a father putting his young son to bed:
“I begin tucking him into bed and he tells me, “Daddy, check for monsters under my bed.” 
I look underneath for his amusement and see him, another him, under the bed, 
staring back at me quivering and whispering, “Daddy, there’s somebody on my bed.”

I heard her scream. (self.shortscarystories)
What is happening to that poor girl ? How can nobody hear her blood 
curdling screams an pleas for help. I must call the police she must be in danger. 
I walked to the basement where I kept my house phone. I looked besides the door and 
there she was, my 14 year old niece crying for help. She was tied with
her hands bound my heart stopped, that’s when the voices kicked in, ‘we must punish her’.
