The light inside (self.shortscarystories)

Anna wandered through the dark trees towards the sharp light in the distance . The darkness felt heavy, frightening and suffocating and the light seemed to hold all the answers; she had to get there.

Branches scraped her brittle skin and blood flowed freely running down her arms and into the soft fabric of her dress but Anna didn’t care. Anna’s eyes stung looking towards the light, she knew she must of been in darkness for some time but the light was all there was; it was her only chance .

Anna was getting close, she could now see past the trees and into the clearing; it was a park, there were children in the distance playing on slides and swings and parents milling around on benches. She was so close.

Finally Anna reached the light, the sun hit her skin as she broke through and it almost burned with its warmth, it had been so long . Happiness burst through her like lightning as she began her approach to the park. She was free.

Anna felt the hand grab her throat for just an instant before she felt herself being pulled back into the forest, back into the darkness. Anna tried to scream but she could no longer breathe. As she was dragged through the forest Anna watched as the light grew smaller and smaller until she could no longer see it.

This had been her only chance, she had spent months loosening the screws in the basement window with her now broken fingers for this chance, the chance to be free from her captor.

There would be no more chances, only pain and suffering awaited Anna now, unbearable suffering until her body gave out, until she died like the others. Oh how Anna wished he would just let her die.
