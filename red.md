The Voicemail (self.shortscarystories)

I opened up my phone this morning to the usual texts and Instagram notifications, but was a little confused when I had ten missed calls from a blocked number and an unopened voicemail. I’m not easily frightened so I decided to take a listen to it. It was just a series of numbers being read they were as followed ...

7, 5, 20,15, 21, 20 followed by a beep and then replayed

I was really confused by it and thought oh must have been a wrong number calling...until I looked in to codes (there were 6 more numbers but it spelled my name and for privacy I’m not giving those ones out.) The letters corresponded to “get out my name”

I was obviously very uneasy but went about getting ready for the day. As I walked out the door there was a man I hadn’t seen before I said hello and he responded...

“Hello my name, you should have listened to your voicemail”
